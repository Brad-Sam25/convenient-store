## Getting Started

For instructions to add Redux to your application, refer to the [Redux Fundamentals basic tutorial](https://redux.js.org/basics/basic-tutorial). Note that the documentation will refer to additional packages that you'll need to complete this implementation.

**Important**: Be sure to review ALL of the documentation, because there are newer methods that can make these tools much easier to implement. React has gone through several iterations; as such, some React-and-Redux tutorials will assume that you aren't using Hooks.
